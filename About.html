			<P> BIOGRAPHY</P>
			<p1>
				In 1999 AD, at the middle of the night i was born in torsha which is a small village. I am first son of Chandra Bdr. Pulami and Sita Devi Pulami. Dad is in military and till now, he is on his military serivce in indian army. For education my father joined the army before i take place in this world. And i went for joining the school. When i was 3 years old, i left my home for education and started to stay with maternal sisters in town. After 7 years later, my whole family migrate to town and started to stay with me. I was first son so, i have my young brother too. Feeling of happeness, when you with family was unmeasureable at that time. From childhood, i was honest boy and do things in certain area of discipline. So, i donot like to distrub others and vica versa. I spent free time of my childhood time, specially watching Hollywood movies. And watching movies made me happy so, it was my best way to be happy at that time. And i was 12 years child who likes to watch hollywood moives because of actors acting was best of the best. And doing this type of activity my childhood was passed. 
			</p1><br>
			<p2>Then at my teengar age started, and i was at 10th grade. And  i gave board exam. After exam, there was rule that holiday was for 3 months. Having for 3 months for holiday was awesome. For 3 month, i knew new things. Before three month, i had any knowledge about outer world. Outer world was never seen by me well. Athough, i was free for doing things. But i donot like to walk in parks and different new places. So, that's why i never Knew about the world before that 3 month ago.
			</p2><br>
			<p3> From age of 16, my life started to change. Different types of thought about world came in my mind, it feels like, it something to do. Process of growth of my body was going as well as from mentally and emotionally too. After that 3 month, result was published and i was safe. 
			</p3><br>
			<p4> i have to take a decision on which faculty would i like to move on. And i made decision by selecting science suject. So, then i went to high for higher education. The way of teaching, learning style and managing the time for everything seems to me very diffcult. I was totally unable to move further. As you hear motivational speech then you get the hope and you have faith on you. That's how i moved on. Then at 12th grade exam result i was failed in math.At that time, I was totallY upset on my result and different thought came in my mind at that time and i was at deprssion. After a 2 weeks later, I try to move again. Then I tried and at back exam result I was safe.

			</p4><br>
			<p5>And for further higher education, I arrived in capital city of our country And i amm studying Bsc.computing on Nami college partnership with University of Northampton and this year is my first year.
